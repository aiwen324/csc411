\paragraph{Introduce}

In this model, we assume the $P(x_i|y)$ is a multinomial distribution rather than Bernoulli distribution. (Notice: Multinomial distribution is not Gaussian Distribution). We still use the same trick to do it, with Laplace smoothing would be have a good model if hte model sample is not too small.
